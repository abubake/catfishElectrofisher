Currently Ongoing development!

All code is written in C, using the esp-idf framework on PlatformIO on VScode. For information on how to set up PlatformIO with esp32 on VScode, follow this link. https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/espressif32/espidf_debugging_unit_testing_analysis.html#tutorial-espressif32-espidf-debugging-unit-testing-analysis

## Application Notes:
* I recommend specifying your COM port in your platform.ini file using "upload_port = COM[3]"
* If a program fails to upload, ensure it is connected to the correct port, try changing your USB cable, and close all terminal sessions, rerunning from the PlatformIO project taskbar using "Upload and Monitor" under the general tab.
